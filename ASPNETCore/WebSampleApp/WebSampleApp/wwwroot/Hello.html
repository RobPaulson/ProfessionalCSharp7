    <h1>Program Execution</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The site begins with Main() in Program.cs.  This Builds the Webhost and directs it to use Startup.cs</li>
        <li>Startup.cs has methods like Configure and ConfigureServices that are called automagically.  Here we also define custom mapping that tells the server how to process specific requests.</li>
        <li>Before the actual response is mapped to the correct app.run configured in Startup.cs any MiddleWare is executed because we added it in the Builder</li>
        <li>And that's really all that is shown here.  Probably more interested in the MVC chapter.</li>
    </ul>
